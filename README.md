# Applied Numerical Methods

This repository contains a collection of **applied numerical methods implemented in Python**, developed for experimentation, learning, and validation of numerical algorithms. The project serves as a **sandbox for testing different numerical techniques**, with multiple methods organized into separate folders.

The focus of this repository is on understanding **convergence, stability, accuracy, and practical behavior** of numerical methods rather than building a single application.

---

## Overview

Each directory in this repository represents a **category of numerical methods**, containing independent Python scripts that implement and test specific algorithms commonly used in engineering and scientific computing.
